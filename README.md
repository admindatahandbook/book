#  Idea Handbook

This is the development area for the "Using Administrative Data for Research and Evidence-based Policy - A Handbook", supported by IDEA @ J-PAL.

## Structure

Development goes on in the `master` branch, which may therefore contain incomplete or preliminary documents. 

Peer-reviewed and sanctioned versions are available in the `published_version` branch. Only those are used to generate websites and printed documents. The subfolder `testing` within the branch will contain unofficial version prior to publication.

> To compile the current version, it is no longer possible to use Github Actions, as the Docker image used requires more than the 7GB RAM available through Github Actions. Creating a new version requires upwards of 16GB of RAM. The command `_build_local.sh` will work on any system with Docker installed and at least 16GB of RAM.


## Publishing

Creating a new published version is a manual process.

### Step 1: Define a version number

See our [versioning guide](96_00_contributing.Rmd).

### Step 2: Create a new version from the testing folder

Ensure that the testing folder is up-to-date (check if [Actions](actions/) might have failed, and verify the URL (REPO)/testing). If it all looks fine, the creation is a simple rename. 

#### GUI version

- Go to [Actions](actions/)
- Select the "Create new version"  workflow
  - Select the "Use workflow from Branch:published_version"
- Choose the grey "Run workflow" option.
  - Enter your Name
  - Enter the new version number (starting with numeric part, e.g., `0.0-rc1` or `1.0.3` - the "v" will be prepended)
- Choose the green "Run workflow" option 

This will rename the "testing" folder to the new version number. The new version will be an exact copy of the old "testing" folder. The "testing" URL will not work until a new change is made.

#### Experts: From the command line

Command-line actions are below:

```
git checkout published_version
git mv testing (VERSION)
git commit -m '[skipci] Creating new version (VERSION) from testing'
git push
```

### Step 3: Register the new version

This is currently a manual process:

- Go to [Actions](actions/)
- Select the "Set version and redirect"  workflow
  - Select the "Use workflow from Branch:published_version"
- Choose the grey "Run workflow" option.
  - Enter your Name
- Choose the green "Run workflow" option 

This will update and deploy the "index.html" and redirect to the highest published version.

### Step 4: Record new DOI for the handbook and chapters.

Each version gets new DOI, but they can record a link to the previous version. See our [DOI Registration Guide](_process/DOI_Registration.md).
