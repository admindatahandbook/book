High Security,"**Example:** The [FSRDC][Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDC)] network maintains a network of 29 locations [@unitedstatescensusbureaua]. While these secure rooms are located at partner organizations (universities, research centers, Federal Reserve Banks), the rooms themselves are under the control of the US Census Bureau and none contain any data. Each secure room contains multiple [thin clients]. Researchers travel (across campus or to a partner organization) to use the thin clients to access analysis computers located within the secure computing center of the Census Bureau [@unitedstatescensusbureaua]."
Medium Security,"**Example:** Data distributed under the [NCES restricted-use data license][National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Restricted-Use Data License] must be kept in a locked room with access restricted only to licensed researchers, and the security arrangements are subject to random audits by NCES."
Low Security,"**Example:** The Stanford-SFUSD Partnership uses low security access locations. While the data are stored on secured servers at Stanford, researchers can access the data from anywhere as long as they take reasonable and appropriate efforts to keep the data secure from unauthorized access as specified in their DUA."
